# find-duplicates

This repository is home for the project for organizing my media backups. Problem is that the media files from phone are automatically backed up to single folder in OneDrive when using Camera upload feature. I want to backup everything from Whatsapp images and videos to actual camera roll in different locations and keep them organized. I figured that best idea is to download the whole OneDrive contents to local drive and organize it with python scripts and sync back to cloud. During the time I have moved media from one place to other which has created lots of duplicate files. 

1. Identify the duplicates and make sure they are stored one place that is most relevant
2. Separate media from apps (e.g. Whatsapp) and actual camera roll in different folders
